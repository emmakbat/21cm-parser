# 21cm-parser
Parse .rad files for MIT's 21 cm radio astronomy telescope

Includes a parsing function for square sun scans with azel coords and a parsing function for galactic scans of arbitrary length using galactic coords. Feel free to alter in any way to make it more useful for your particular data. The functions both use the provided Measurement class to make the data easier to access.
